# **KEPLER EXOPLANET ML MODEL**
---
## ML project completed under Loop Summer Mentorship Program.
### The models I used along with accuracy scores :-
1. Logistic Regression = 99.18
2. Naive Bayes Classifier = 99.13
3. Random Forst Classifier = 99.13
4. Support Vector Machine (SVM) = 99.08

includes all required visualisation of algorithms and alternate approaches.

At last confusion matrix used for selecting best algo.
